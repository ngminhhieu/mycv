\sectionTitle{Summary}{\faBook}

My research focuses on \textbf{machine learning} and \textbf{artificial intelligence}, with particular emphasis on \textbf{federated learning}, \textbf{recommender systems}, \textbf{time-series analysis}, and \textbf{trustworthy AI}. 
My work aims to develop robust, efficient, and explainable learning frameworks that address \emph{data sparsity}, \emph{non-IID distributions}, and \emph{reliability} in \emph{real-world data-driven systems}.

\textbf{Research:} Author of \textbf{12 peer-reviewed publications}, including \textbf{6 international conference papers} (\textbf{1 CORE $A^*$}) and \textbf{6 Q1 journal articles}. Research topics include \emph{machine learning}, \emph{time-series forecasting}, \emph{graph learning}, \emph{recommender systems}, and \emph{federated learning}.

\textbf{Teaching:} \textbf{Teaching assistant and tutor} at \textbf{Griffith University} across \textbf{five academic semesters}, contributing to \emph{tutorial delivery}, \emph{student consultation}, \emph{assessment support}, and \emph{coordination with course convenors} in \textbf{computer science}, \textbf{data science}, and \textbf{artificial intelligence} courses. Recipient of the \textbf{2024 Student Experience of Teaching Survey Commendation}.

\textbf{Grant support:} Contributed to the preparation of \textbf{two successful Australian Government–funded research grants} under the \textbf{Aus4Innovation program}, supporting \emph{literature review}, \emph{methodology design}, and \emph{technical sections}.

\textbf{Software \& engineering:} Strong background in \textbf{Python-based research} and \textbf{software development}, with experience building \emph{machine learning pipelines}, \emph{experimental frameworks}, and \emph{full-stack systems} to support \textbf{research and teaching activities}.
