\sectionTitle{Summary}{\faBook}

My research focuses on \textbf{agentic AI and model security}, with particular emphasis on \emph{federated learning, LLMs, recommender
systems, and time series}. My work aims to develop robust, efficient, and explainable learning frameworks that address
data sparsity, non-IID distributions, and reliability in real-world data-driven systems.

\textbf{Research:} Author of 12 peer-reviewed publications, including \textbf{6 international conference papers} (\textbf{1 CORE $A^*$}) and \textbf{5 Q1 journal articles}. My CORE A* paper pioneered hypergraph-based market prediction, achieving a 20\% gain over state-of-the-art methods with 50+ citations.

\textbf{Teaching:} Teaching assistant and tutor at Griffith University across \textbf{five academic semesters}, contributing to tutorial delivery, student consultation, assessment support, and coordination with course convenors. Recipient of the \textbf{2024 Student Experience of Teaching Survey Commendation}.

\textbf{Grant support:} Contributed to the preparation of \textbf{two successful Australian Government–funded research grants} under the \textbf{Aus4Innovation program}, supporting literature review, methodology design, and technical sections.

\textbf{Software \& engineering:} Strong background in Python-based research and software development, with experience building machine learning pipelines, experimental frameworks, and full-stack systems to support research and teaching activities. The GitHub repository for my CORE A* paper has gained \textbf{70+ stars and 30+ forks}.
